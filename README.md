# Ideas For Touchless Accessibility
## Application Ideas
**in addition to all time estimates, time must be allocated to improving or re-designing the eye-detection algorithm.
### Touchless Option for Bluff
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 20 hours_  
Shuffle through cards with one node. Use other nodes for card selection or special moves such as a "bluff".  

### Touchless Option for Map-Explorer
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 20 hours_  
Use four corner nodes to move north, east, south, west.  
Remaining two nodes can be used for special actions such as accessing geographic information.

### Touchless Option for Maths Tutor
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 60 hours_  
Transform questions into multiple choice and use 4 nodes to select option and other two to advance and ask for hint, etc.  
OR  
Allow number input through a sequence of facial cues (such as blinking however many times and another action to signal start and end)  

### Touchless Option for Chess
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 30 hours_  
Scrolling through the pieces. Consider using another facial cue such as mouth to scroll faster (better UX).  

### Touchless Option for Snakes & Ladders
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 10 hours_  
Roll dice controls. Other nodes for special moves to spice things up (power-ups?).  

### Touchless Typing (can extend to email sending/texting)
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 60 hours_  
Use a facial cue to signal switch controls from typing to email sending controls.  
Typing can be achieved through the braille typing method (PROS: perfectly implementable 6 nodes. CONS: requires learning of braille)  
Typing can be achieved through 4 select nodes, 1 delete node and 1 scroll node (in the scroll, not only letters but also special characters and enter should be included).  
Other button-limited typing methods should be investigated as well.  
Implement generation algorithms that help fill in the rest of the word (if so, leave a node for confirming that) and to calculate the most likely next letters and place those in the fastest reachable areas (first scroll page).  
Email sending or texting can be connected as a Google Chrome extension. Use nodes for tasks such as send, confirm send, switch to email header/recipients.  

### Google Navigation
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 60 hours_  
Google Chrome extension. Nodes for navigating, picking, searching, clicking, typing. (feasible, must optimize UX).  
Alternative mouse-moving method: look in a certain direction and mouse goes towards there slowly, close eyes when reach that place. (less feasible)  

### E-Book Extension / TV, YouTube, Netflix Extensions
_Estimated Solo Implementation Time: 60 hours_  
Nodes for actions like flip page forwards, flip backwards, bookmark, change text size, etc.  
Nodes for actions like skip forwards 30 secs (rather than 10s because completing the action will take a number of seconds), pause/unpause, rewind, scroll and select show, etc.  
Big idea: help empower by regaining hobbies, and independence and allowing possibilities of learning and exploring passions and knowledge. Step towards reducing stereotypes of incapability.
